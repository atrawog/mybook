# Face It, You Need This
## A Python Script That Sorts Photos by Similarity and Face Recognition

> Write my a python script that can sort pictures by similarity and face recognition.

To create a Python script that sorts pictures by similarity and face recognition, we need to use a deep learning library like Dlib, OpenCV, and/or face_recognition library. This script will use the face_recognition library, which is built on top of Dlib, to encode faces and then compare them for similarity.

1. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python-headless numpy
```

2. Create a Python script called `sort_pictures.py`:

```python
import os
import sys
import cv2
import face_recognition
import numpy as np

def load_images(folder):
    images = {}
    for filename in os.listdir(folder):
        if filename.endswith(".jpg") or filename.endswith(".png"):
            img_path = os.path.join(folder, filename)
            img = face_recognition.load_image_file(img_path)
            images[filename] = img
    return images

def calculate_face_encodings(images):
    encodings = {}
    for name, img in images.items():
        face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(img)
        if len(face_locations) > 0:
            face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(img, face_locations)[0]
            encodings[name] = face_encoding
    return encodings

def sort_images_by_similarity(target_face_encoding, encodings):
    similarities = {}
    for name, encoding in encodings.items():
        similarity = np.linalg.norm(target_face_encoding - encoding)
        similarities[name] = similarity
    sorted_images = sorted(similarities.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    return sorted_images

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python sort_pictures.py <image_folder> <target_image>")
        sys.exit(1)

    image_folder = sys.argv[1]
    target_image_path = sys.argv[2]

    images = load_images(image_folder)
    encodings = calculate_face_encodings(images)

    target_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(target_image_path)
    target_face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(target_image)

    if len(target_face_locations) == 0:
        print("No face found in target image.")
        sys.exit(1)

    target_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(target_image, target_face_locations)[0]
    sorted_images = sort_images_by_similarity(target_face_encoding, encodings)

    print("\nSorted images by similarity to target image:")
    for name, similarity in sorted_images:
        print(f"{name}: {similarity}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

3. Usage:

Prepare a folder containing the images you want to sort and a target image whose face you want to use as the reference. Then, run the script like this:

```bash
python sort_pictures.py <image_folder> <target_image>
```

Replace `<image_folder>` with the path to the folder containing the images and `<target_image>` with the path to the target image. The script will output the sorted list of image filenames along with their similarity scores.

> Can you write me a version that works with multiple faces and renames the pictures to a filename starting with the detected faces?

Sure! Here's a modified version of the `sort_pictures.py` script that processes multiple faces in the target image and renames the input images based on the detected face with the highest similarity.

```python
import os
import sys
import cv2
import face_recognition
import numpy as np
import shutil

def load_images(folder):
    images = {}
    for filename in os.listdir(folder):
        if filename.endswith(".jpg") or filename.endswith(".png"):
            img_path = os.path.join(folder, filename)
            img = face_recognition.load_image_file(img_path)
            images[filename] = img
    return images

def calculate_face_encodings(images):
    encodings = {}
    for name, img in images.items():
        face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(img)
        if len(face_locations) > 0:
            face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(img, face_locations)
            encodings[name] = face_encodings
    return encodings

def sort_images_by_similarity(target_face_encodings, encodings):
    similarities = {}
    for name, face_encodings in encodings.items():
        best_similarity = float('inf')
        best_target_face = None
        for target_face_encoding in target_face_encodings:
            for face_encoding in face_encodings:
                similarity = np.linalg.norm(target_face_encoding - face_encoding)
                if similarity < best_similarity:
                    best_similarity = similarity
                    best_target_face = target_face_encoding
        similarities[name] = (best_similarity, best_target_face)
    sorted_images = sorted(similarities.items(), key=lambda x: x[1][0])
    return sorted_images

def rename_images(sorted_images, image_folder, output_folder):
    if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
        os.makedirs(output_folder)
    for i, (name, (similarity, face_encoding)) in enumerate(sorted_images):
        new_name = f"{i+1:04d}_{name}"
        old_path = os.path.join(image_folder, name)
        new_path = os.path.join(output_folder, new_name)
        shutil.copy2(old_path, new_path)
        print(f"Renamed {name} to {new_name}")

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        print("Usage: python sort_pictures.py <image_folder> <target_image> <output_folder>")
        sys.exit(1)

    image_folder = sys.argv[1]
    target_image_path = sys.argv[2]
    output_folder = sys.argv[3]

    images = load_images(image_folder)
    encodings = calculate_face_encodings(images)

    target_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(target_image_path)
    target_face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(target_image)

    if len(target_face_locations) == 0:
        print("No face found in target image.")
        sys.exit(1)

    target_face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(target_image, target_face_locations)
    sorted_images = sort_images_by_similarity(target_face_encodings, encodings)

    rename_images(sorted_images, image_folder, output_folder)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Usage:

Prepare a folder containing the images you want to sort, a target image with multiple faces, and an output folder to store the renamed images. Then, run the script like this:

```bash
python sort_pictures.py <image_folder> <target_image> <output_folder>
```

Replace `<image_folder>` with the path to the folder containing the images, `<target_image>` with the path to the target image containing multiple faces, and `<output_folder>` with the path to the output folder where the renamed images will be stored. The script will copy and rename the input images in the output folder based on the detected face with the highest similarity.

> Great! Can you add docstrings to every function that describe them in more detail?

Each function now has a docstring that provides a more detailed description of its purpose, input parameters, and return values.

> Excellent! Now please generate me a requirements.txt file for pip that includes all packages needed to run this script.

Here's a `requirements.txt` file that includes all the packages needed to run the `sort_pictures.py` script:

```
face_recognition==1.3.0
numpy==1.22.2
opencv-python-headless==4.6.0.66
shutilwhich==1.1.0
```

You can create a `requirements.txt` file with these contents and install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will ensure that all the necessary packages are installed for running the script.
